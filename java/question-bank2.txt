Difference b/w failfast and failsafe iterators ?

Failfast iterators - these throw ConcurrentModification Exception when one Thread is iterating
over collection object while other thread is structurally modifying COllection(adding, deleting, modifying)
objects on underlying collection, They are call failfast because they immediately throw exception when
they encounter failure.

FailSafe - doesnt throw any exception is modified structurally because they work on clone of the 
collection instead of the original Collection.

What do you understand by blocking Queue ?
